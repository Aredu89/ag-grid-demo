## Features Demonstrated

### AG Grid Functionalities

- **Pagination**  
  Displays data in pages with configurable page size (20 rows per page in this demo).

- **Row Selection**  
  Users can select multiple rows for batch operations like deletion.

- **Inline Editing**  
  Users can edit cells directly in the grid. Changes are tracked until explicitly saved.

- **Add/Delete Rows**  
  - New users can be added with the input fields and "Add User" button.
  - Selected rows can be deleted using the "Delete Selected Rows" button.

- **Change Tracking & Save Button**  
  - A "Save Changes" button appears when there are unsaved edits.
  - On click, it logs the pending changes (simulating a save action to an API).

- **Loading Spinner**  
  Displays a loading spinner when data is being fetched.

- **Responsive & Styled Layout**  
  Uses a clean layout with styled inputs, buttons, and grid container.
